The objective of the active learning lab is to enable students to implement the active learning method, specifically focusing on the margin of confidence technique. Through hands-on exercises and practical applications, students will learn to apply the margin of confidence method effectively

Active Learning Framework
1. Initialize data pool with labeled and unlabeled subsets.
2. Train a model on the labeled subset.
3. Iterate:
      Use the model to predict on the unlabeled data.
      Calculate uncertainty for each unlabeled sample.
      Select the most uncertain samples.
      Label selected samples.
      Add labeled samples to the labeled subset.
      Retrain the model.
4. Evaluate model performance.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until a stopping criterion is met or budget is exhausted.
6. Train a final model using all labeled data.
7. Deploy the final model for inference.

Task 1: Implement Margin of Confidence Method
Implement Margin of Confidence Method using following guideline in given loop below.
1. Calculate Probabilities
2. Get top two Probabilities
3. Calculate difference between top two probabilities
4. Calculate uncertainity = 1 - difference
